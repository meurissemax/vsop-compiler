# Compilers

## Context

The goal of this project was to build a small compiler for the **VSOP** language (created by C. Soldani and defined in the `vsop_manual.pdf` file).

The compiler takes as input a `.vsop` file and generates as output a corresponding `.llvm` file. It also allows to view each step (lexing, parsing, ...) separately. 

This project was realized as part of the *Compilers* course given by Professor **Fontaine** to the master students of Civil Engineering at the [University of Li√®ge](https://www.uliege.be/) during the academic year 2019-2020.

## Language

This VSOP compiler was done using **Python** with the help, mainly, of the [PLY](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/) tool.

Other libraries were also used :

* argparse
* pyinstaller

## How to use the compiler ?

The compiler implementation can be found in the `vsop-compiler/code/` folder.

All the resources of a tool (lexer, parser, ...) are in the folder of the same name.

To install all the necessary tools (assuming python is already installed), just do :

```bash
make install-tools
```

To get a compiled version of the compiler, just do :

```bash
make vsopc
```

The compiler can then be used via the command :

```bash
./vsopc <VSOP-SOURCE-FILE>
```

The various options available can be viewed via the command :

```bash
./vsopc -h
```
